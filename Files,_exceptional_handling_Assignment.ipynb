        " . The main difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how the code is executed by the computer.\n",
        "\n",
        ". Compiled Languages: In compiled languages, the source code is translated into machine code (binary code) by a compiler before execution. The compilation process generates an executable file, which can be run directly on the machine.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Interpreted Languages: In interpreted languages, the source code is translated and executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime. The interpreter reads and executes the code directly, without creating an intermediate machine code file.\n",

        "2.What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        ". Exception handling in Python is a mechanism used to handle runtime errors, also known as exceptions, in a controlled way. When an error occurs during program execution, it raises an exception, and the program may terminate unless the exception is handled properly.Python provides a set of keywords (try, except, else, finally) to catch and handle exceptions and ensure that your program runs smoothly even when errors occur.\n",

        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n",
        "\n",
        ". The finally block in Python's exception handling serves an important purpose: it ensures that certain code is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is used for cleanup tasks or actions that must occur after the try block, regardless of the outcome (whether an exception occurred or not).\n",

        "4.What is logging in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        ".Logging in Python is a way to record information about your program's execution. It provides a way to track events, errors, and other significant occurrences during the runtime of a program, which can be essential for debugging, monitoring, and understanding how a program behaves in different environments. Python's built-in logging module provides a flexible framework for writing log messages. Logs can be written to different outputs, such as the console, files, or external systems, and can capture varying levels of detail about the program's execution.\n",

        "\n",
        ". In Python, the __del__ method is a special or \"magic\" method that acts as a destructor for objects. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed, which typically happens when the object’s reference count reaches zero (i.e., no more references to the object exist). This provides an opportunity to release resources or perform cleanup tasks before the object is deleted.\n",

        "\n",
        ". Multithreading: Involves executing multiple threads within the same process. A thread is the smallest unit of a CPU's execution, and all threads in a process share the same memory space. Threads run concurrently but are still part of a single process.\n",
        "\n",
        ".Multiprocessing: Involves executing multiple processes, each with its own independent memory space and resources. Each process runs on its own core (in modern CPUs) and operates independently of others.\n",

        "\n",
        ". Logging is a powerful tool for tracking and monitoring the execution of a program, providing insights into its behavior and helping diagnose issues.

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "15.How does Python's garbage collection system work ?\n",
        "\n",
        ". Python's garbage collection system is responsible for automatically managing memory by reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. This helps prevent memory leaks, where unused memory is not freed, leading to increased memory consumption and, eventually, potential crashes or performance degradation. Python’s garbage collection combines reference counting and cycle detection to handle most memory management tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
        "\n",
        ". In Python, the else block is used in conjunction with try and except blocks as part of exception handling. The primary purpose of the else block is to allow code that should only be executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        ". Key Points About the else Block:\n",
        "\n",
        ". Executed Only if No Exception Occurs: The else block is executed only if the code inside the try block completes successfully, meaning no exception was raised. If an exception occurs in the try block, Python will jump to the corresponding except block (if there is one), and the else block is skipped entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        ". Helps Separate Normal Code from Error-Handling Code: Using the else block allows you to separate the code that deals with exceptions from the code that executes when no exceptions occur. This makes your code cleaner and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What are the common logging levels in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        ". Python's built-in logging module provides a flexible framework for logging messages from your application. Each log message is assigned a logging level, which helps categorize the severity or importance of the log message. These levels define the threshold of severity for the log to be captured.\n",

        "\n",
        ". Let's explore the key differences:\n",
        "\n",
        ". os.fork(): Purpose: os.fork() is a low-level system call available on Unix-like operating systems (Linux, macOS, etc.) that allows a program to create a child process by duplicating the calling process. It is a part of the os module.\n",
        "\n",
        ". multiprocessing Module: Purpose: The multiprocessing module is a high-level abstraction in Python that allows you to create and manage multiple processes in a more portable and convenient way.\n",

        "\n",
        ". In Python, when you open a file for reading, writing, or appending, it is crucial to close the file after you're done using it. Closing a file ensures that all changes are saved, resources are freed, and the file is properly closed to avoid potential issues\n",
